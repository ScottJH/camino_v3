He first experienced the Camino de Santiago in 2002, when he walked from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, then returning on foot back to St. Jean – a 1,000-mile journey round-trip. Since then, Daniel has walked the Camino Francés four more times, and the Via de la Plata once. He has also served as volunteer hospitalero in Grañon.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Founder, <em>La Flecha Amarilla</em></strong></p>
                    <p>Sandy has been on the Camino since as far back as 2001, and began <a href=" http://www.laflechaamarilla.com" target="_blank"><em>La Flecha Amarilla</em></a>, as a family initiative. Through the support of wine sales, Sandy brings drug-rehabilitated youth to walk the Camino de Santiago, where they get the chance to learn new cooking or language skills, to make new friends, and to glimpse how wonderful life can be when getting fit and doing something positive for themselves. Working together with Judy Colinari of <em>Spanish Steps</em>, the project adopted the slogan, "As we get clean, so we clean the Camino."
                    </p>
                    <p>Sandy was originally born in México, lived in the U.S. for most of her adult life, and finally moved to Spain in the spring of 2007. She can often be found along the Camino making deliveries, talking to pilgrims, helping as an hospitalera in the company of the family dog, Lolita, who adopted Sandy in Galicia while she and her son were walking the Camino in 2008. Today, Sandy and Lolita spend their time between Spain, México and the US.

                    John Brierley</h2>
                    <p><strong>Author, <em>The Camino Guides</em></strong></p>
                    <p>John Brierley is the author of <em>A Pilgrim’s Guide to the Camino de Santiago</em>, upon which the crew of <em>Walking the Camino</em> relied heavily during filming. This book is just one among his set of practical and mystical manuals for the modern-day pilgrim: <a href="http://www.caminoguides.com" target="_blank"><em>Camino Pilgrim Guides</em></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>John earned his qualification as a Chartered Surveyor in Dublin, Ireland, and established Brierley & Co. (to be later merged with Jackson-Stops) at the age of 21. In 1987, an existential crisis and mid-career proved to be a pivotal time in his life, sparking a reordering of priorities towards a spiritual perspective. He and his family struck out in a camper van to ‘travel the world,’ stumbled onto the Camino de Santiago, and felt its welcoming embrace for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Focused on reorienting his life towards an inner pathway, John set up home in the spiritual community at Findhorn in Scotland. In 1996, he convened the international conference, <em>Business for Life</em>, with the crisis of the human spirit and the search for meaning in life as its core issues. His abiding passion became the concept of business-sabbaticals as an antidote to burn-out, and the idea of pilgrimage as a way to reappraise one’s life purpose.

Her specialization is in the sociology of religion, with a particular interest in religion in late modernity. She is currently spearheading research that examines the psycho-social health benefits for Canadian Baby Boomers who walk the Camino.
                        </p>
                        <p>In April 2010, Joanne spent five weeks on the Camino Francés with her husband, two daughters (11 and 8) and mother (78) in tow. Through town and country, sideways rain and sweltering heat, in sickness and in health, they walked, talked and connected with one another, fellow pilgrims, and the journey itself in both deep and simple ways.

                    (Website/Facebook/Subtitles/Interviews)</strong></p>
                    <p>Carmel was born in La Habana, Cuba. After the Revolution, her family lived in Paris for five years before answering the call of friends and family and moving to Madrid, Spain. She attended French schools and received the French Baccalauréat, staying in close contact with her classmates for the last 40 years. Her professional choice of a teaching career, after receiving her BA and MA in Romance Languages from the University of California campuses at Chico and Santa Barbara, allowed her to discover that the boarding-school lifestyles of New England were best suited to her talents and vocation. Currently, she serves the Spanish-speaking population as a medical interpreter and translator at a local community hospital, while also volunteering in a variety of activities such as tutoring children and working in a local thrift shop.
                    </p>
                    <p>A passionate traveler, reader, amateur watercolor painter, choral singer and music lover, Carmel devotes her time to her small family and circle of friends. She finds fulfillment in doing so. She hopes to travel to Northern Spain with her husband, Chris, in June 2011 and finally heed the Camino's call.

                    <p>Emilio Roura lives in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, just 10 kilometers south of Barcelona, Spain. A retired Primary school teacher, he taught the Spanish and Catalan languages, and trained teachers in the Catalan language, as well. He has been teaching Spanish to the sons and daughters of Spanish emigrators in Britain for the last 6 years. Some years ago, Emilio walked the Camino Francés with his wife, taking about six weeks to make the trek from Roncesvalles to Santiago. Since then, he has held a great appreciation and enthusiasm for the lovely experience the Camino gives to those who walk it. It is for that reason that Emilio has been avidly collaborating with <em>Walking the Camino</em>, as he believes it will be very interesting for many people to do the walk and discover that experience themselves.

He and his family are planning on walking the Camino during the summer of 2012. For Juan, it will be particularly challenging since he is an insulin-dependent diabetic, but they all look forward to this great adventure.
