                    Lydia B. Smith</h2>
                    <p><strong>Director/Producer</strong></p>
                    <p>Lydia B. Smith has been involved in the film industry for more than a quarter of a century, and has a long history of collaboration with the Producers on this project. Lydia directed, produced and wrote: <em>They’re Just Kids</em>, a 26-minute educational documentary on how children with disabilities can positively affect our lives; <em>A Legacy Revealed</em>, a 40-minute historical documentary; and the 20-minute biography, <em>Bill Lansing: A Tribute</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, Lydia was Senior Producer on CNN’s <em>Soldiers of Peace: A Children’s Crusade</em>; Co-Producer and 2nd Unit Director of Photography on the CNN documentary, <em>The Mystery of the Arctic Rose</em>; 2nd Unit Director of Photography on the PBS program, <em>Stand Up</em>; American Producer for Chilean TV’s <em>The Route of the Beringia</em>; Director of Photography for <em>Anthony Hopkins Teaches</em>; and many more. In addition to her producing and directing career, Lydia has worked as Camera Assistant and Operator on major motion pictures, national commercials, and top music videos. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Lydia is the perfect Director/Producer for <em>Walking the Camino</em>. She lived in Spain for over six years and speaks flawless Spanish, in addition to Italian and Catalan. A lover of hiking and nature, Lydia is also a licensed Spiritual Practitioner from the Agape International Spiritual Center and from the United Centers for Spiritual Living.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the Spring of 2008, she walked the Camino de Santiago and the effects it had on her were truly life-changing. Along the way, she realized that she was not fulfilling her life’s purpose. Since the Camino is all about stepping out of one’s comfort zones, Lydia felt called to step into her full potential and direct this, her first feature-length film.</p>
                    <p>Her intention is for the film to positively change lives, just as the Camino does, and to inspire people to follow their own path of discovery and transformation.

                    <p><strong>Associate Producer/Assistant Editor</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    KC Englander earned her BFA in Film, Photography &amp; Visual Arts from Ithaca College's Roy H. Park School of Communications in 2008. Later that year, she moved to Portland, OR on a whim, where she fatefully connected with Director Lydia B. Smith and Producer Sally Bentley, and started out as an Intern on <em>Walking the Camino's</em> pre-production.
                    </p>
                    <p>KC has been an integral support to the project ever since, assuming an ever-expanding range of responsibilities: from media manager and all-purpose assistant duties on the film's shoot; to volunteer and edit-preparation coordination; to the drafting of grant proposals; to bookkeeping; to co-creating fundraising initiatives; to assisting on the film's fundraising trailer and cutting pilgrim and history selects; to co-directing content and design for the film's website relaunch, <a href="get_involved.php">Power of One</a> campaign and social media pages. She is extremely grateful for this breadth of experience, and is awestruck by her fortune to have begun her professional career on a project as incomparable as this film. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When not hard at work, KC can be found creating her own film shorts and art installations, singing and playing the mountain dulcimer, and skating under the moniker/alter-ego, "The Blast Unicorn," for the world's largest and winningest flat-track roller-derby league, Portland's <em>Rose City Rollers</em>!

It was there that she met Lydia more than 25 years ago, and the two have never lost touch. Despite the distance and infrequency of their time together, her friendship with Lydia has deepened and intensified so greatly over the years that she now considers her a best friend. She has not walked the Camino, but when Lydia walked the Camino last year, her love and enthusiasm for the journey was contagious.

                    <p>Olga is thrilled to help as much as possible on the shooting of <em>Walking the Camino</em>. She is very excited to be part of the team, to serve as chef for pre-production, and to lend an extra hand for the first week of production. She is convinced this is going to be an unforgettable experience and an absolutely marvelous film.
