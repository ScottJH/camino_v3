 	<h1>Camino Tour Supporters 2013</h1>
    	<p>In June of 2013, we celebrated the week before our European Premiere of the film in collaboration with Carpe Diem of Galicia for another successful Fundraising Tour.  We started where we finished on our last walk together in Santiago de Compostela, and this time walked on the lesser-known path of the Camino Finisterre-Muxia. We had some returning pilgrims of our 2011 tour, as well as three new pilgrims who quickly picked up the walking spirit of the group. Each of these special ladies also donated generously to the film, and their support is immensely appreciated. </p>
    	<p>A Special Thanks goes out to all our Tour contributors.  If you are planning on walking the Camino Finisterre-Muxía, each of these places and people along the way will not only make your trip even more incredible, but you will be treated to an authentic taste of the true Galicía beyond the borders of Santiago and along the Costa de Morte.</p>

		<a href="http://www.casadebola.com" target="_blank"><h3>Casa de Bola</h3></a>
		<p>Built in 1830, you feel like you have walked in the house of Galician royalty, in this meticulously renovated home.  On the outskirts of Negreira, this “casa rural” provides a private oasis perfect for relaxation and enjoying the Galician country side.  If you end your walk in Negreira, Jesús the homeowner will personally come to pick you up from the middle of town to drive the few kilometers to this destination perfect for individuals and small groups.</p>

		<a href="http://www.ruralsantiago.com" target="_blank"><h3>Casa Gasamáns</h3></a>
		<p>On the other side of Negreira, this wonderful property is more than 100 years old, yet wonderfully updated for every comfort. Bordered by native forest on one side and the River Tambre on the other, the property of Casa Gasamans features accommodation for as many as 23 guests, gardens, swimming pool, and lounge areas.  With one of the owner’s also a trained Chef, we were also fortunate enough to have one of our meals at Casa Gasamáns where the food was as divine as this destination.</p>

		<a href="http://www.cabanasdelires.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Cabanas de Lires</h3></a>
		<p>Located 14km from both Finisterre and Muxía, the Cabañas de Lires not only provide a perfect middle point for the final chapter of this route, but also a great central point for any part of the Camino Finisterre-Muxía.  Ines and Braulio (and the entire family) play perfect hosts at these three cabins and neighboring Casa Jesús that are surrounded by trees, gardens, and a pool for post-walking relax time.  If you plan ahead, Grandma is on hand to provide a home-cooked dinner experience, which we took advantage of with a traditional Galician BBQ and Octopus feast! It also looks like the perfect place to bring a family for a little rural holiday a short jump away from Santiago.</p>

		<img src="images/supporters/logo_casa_de_trillo.png" id="imgLeft" alt="" />
		<a href="http://www.casadetrillo.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Casa de Trillo</h3></a>
		<p>Distinguished as the first establishment in the region with a “Q for Quality”, Casa de Trillo combines comfort with luxury.  With traceable history back to 1558, this was indeed our oldest spot we stayed in, but again, you would never know with the perfectly restored accomdations. Our hosts, Jesús and Rosa, were so gracious and the food was amazing as they are also a member of Slow Food, the eco-gastronomic organization.  Our elaborate dinners were matched by equally as delicious breakfast spreads. If you are celebrating your final ending of the Camino, you couldn’t pick a better spot than with the Trillos.</p>

		<p>While we only got to tour and enjoy coffee at the like-new Albergue San Jose in Negreira, the Albergue’s owner and Camino aficionado, Perry Vieito generously provided our transportation for the week.  He patiently waited for us as we walked and ferried our luggage from spot to spot, as he does for pilgrims staying at the “San Jose”.  A perfect resting place for both pilgrims seeking a traditional albergue experience, or for those in need of a private room, the Albergue is a great way to stay in the center of Negreira and enjoy pilgrim life.  Like to fish? Perry, who became truly one of the group, might even show you some good fishing spots...</p>

With a breakfast to die for and perfect access to the Cathedral, this hotel is our official home away from home in Santiago!</p>
