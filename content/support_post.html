		<p>With one of our favorite views of the trip, we couldn’t resist exploring every inch of the four-star El Paraiso del Bierzo in order to catch a glimpse of each of their beautifully decorated double and single rooms.  We split our group in two this night and all enjoyed intimate dinner conversation over a meal that was put together with love just for our participants to get a great sampling of what the region had to offer.</p>

		<p>Carris Hoteles, a name synonymous with quality in Galicia, generously donated rooms during our stay in Sarría and celebration of hitting the 100km mark.  Alfonso IX also played host to our packed Sarria FUNDRAISER/SCREENING that included many members of the local community with an interest in the film.  Additionally, Carris donated a few more rooms in Santiago at their new property, Casa de la Troya, a modern delight in the middle of the Zona Vieja for some of our special guests who joined us at the conclusion of our trip.</p>

		<p>The perfect stop a few steps off the Camino Frances is the quaint Pazo de Sedor that offers some of the comforts of home while on the trail and generously donated rooms to the tour.  With meals and everything prepared in-house, once you step through the door of this Pazo you will be content throughout your stay here.</p>
